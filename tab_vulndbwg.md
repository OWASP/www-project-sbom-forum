## Vulnerability Database Working Group

**Background**

It no longer makes sense (if it ever did make sense) for a vulnerability data consumer to simply hitch their wagon to a single vulnerability database like the NVD. There are – and have always been – a lot of different ways to approach the vulnerability data problem, due to the variety of software identifiers, vulnerability identifiers, vulnerability reporting mechanisms and actors, vulnerable products (open source, closed source and intelligent devices), etc. Today, it would be a mistake for a vulnerability data consumer to ignore all these differences and just choose one database to fulfill all their needs, as many organizations did with the NVD.

The purpose of the Vulnerability Database Working Group is to “pull all the threads” of the discussion, and document how vulnerability data consumers can utilize the many available sources of vulnerability information, both now and in the near-term future. The other purpose of the group is to discuss and document what might be the best longer-term solution(s) to this problem.

**Meetings**

Our group currently meets bi-weekly on Tuesdays at 11AM Eastern Time – probably the best time to include people from California, Europe, and Israel in a single meeting. It is open to all interested parties. To receive the meeting invitations, email [Tom Alrich](mailto:tom@tomalrich.com). We would very much like to expand and accelerate our efforts, especially given the critical situation in which vulnerability data consumers currently find themselves. This includes weekly meetings and a much more aggressive schedule for publishing our findings. 

**Meetings**

You can support the Vulnerability Database Working Group’s efforts through a donation of $1,000 or more to OWASP, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The donation should be directed to the SBOM Forum. Please email Tom Alrich to discuss this.
