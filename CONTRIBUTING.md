# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The SBOM Forum. We welcome all contributions and appreciate your efforts to improve the global SBOM ecosystem.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing please email tom@tomalrich.com to be added to the mailing lists we use for coordinating activities. This project has just transitioned to OWASP and we are just getting started with systems, so these guidelines may change.

### Working with OWASP Projects

Additionally, to learn more about getting involved with other OWASP projects:

1. [Join](http://owasp.org/slack/invite) the [OWASP Slack workspace](https://owasp.slack.com) to connect with the OWASP community and get help with any questions you may have.

2. Review the [OWASP Projects](https://owasp.org/projects/) page to browse the list of OWASP projects and find a project that aligns with your interests and skills.

3. Visit the project's individual page and repository to familiarize yourself with the project goals and objectives.

4. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

5. Install any necessary dependencies and set up your development environment.

6. Make your changes and test them locally to ensure they work as expected.

7. Submit a pull request with your changes.

## Code of Conduct

We ask that all contributors to The SBOM Forum abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct). This code outlines our expectations for behavior within the project community and helps us maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

Thank you for your interest in contributing. We appreciate your efforts to help us improve and grow SBOM!
