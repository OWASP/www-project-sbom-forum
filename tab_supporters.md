The SBOM Forum is the result of a global community of SBOM Advocates.

But we have also been helped by many organizations, either financially or by encouraging their employees to work on SBOM Forum Initiatives:

## Supporting the SBOM Forum

There are three ways you can support our work. All three are appreciated!

1.	You can participate in our meetings and help create documents with us. See above.
2.	You can donate to the OWASP Foundation (minimum $10), to help them carry out their great work promoting software security. Click the “Donate” button in the top right corner. The OWASP Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization. Therefore, in some cases your gift may be tax-deductible. You should consult with a tax professional for more details. Note that your gift will support the general work of the OWASP Foundation.
3.	You can make a “restricted” donation to the OWASP Foundation, which is restricted to supporting the SBOM Forum. The minimum restricted donation is $1,000. The OWASP Foundation charges the SBOM Forum a 10% administrative fee to cover their costs in administering this type of donation, which we believe is justified by the strong level of support they have provided to our group. Your logo will appear on our page if your organization is able to donate at one of these three levels: Silver ($5,000+), Gold ($10,000+) or Platinum ($25,000+). However, any donation is greatly appreciated!


If you would like to make a restricted donation, you can simply click on the “Donate” button in the upper right corner of the main SBOM Forum web page. On the next page, you should choose “Other” when asked to choose an amount for a donation. You will be prompted to enter an amount and asked to enter your email address and name (of course, if you’re donating on behalf of a company, you should enter the company name, although you can enter your email). 

If you enter an amount over $1,000 (the minimum for a restricted donation), a checkbox will appear which reads “Please restrict this gift for OWASP SBOM Forum…” Please check that box.

Please email <tom@tomalrich.com> if you would like to discuss donations and what they will be used for.
