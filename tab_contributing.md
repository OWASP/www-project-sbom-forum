# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The SBOM Forum. We welcome all contributions and appreciate your efforts to improve the global SBOM ecosystem.

## Weekly Meetings

We meet every Friday at 1:00 PM ET for the general meetings, all are welcome to join. In addition, we host a separate subgroup on the following topic also on Fridays:
* VEX Playbooks

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing please email tom@tomalrich.com to be added to the mailing lists we use for coordinating activities. This project has just transitioned to OWASP and we are just getting started with systems, so these guidelines may change.

## Code of Conduct

We ask that all contributors to The SBOM Forum abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct){:target="_blank"}. This code outlines our expectations for behavior within the project community and helps us maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

Thank you for your interest in contributing. We appreciate your efforts to help us improve and grow SBOM!
