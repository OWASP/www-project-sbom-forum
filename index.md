The SBOM Forum identifies and tries to find solutions to problems that are preventing widespread distribution and use of SBOMs by private and public organizations.

## Weekly Meetings

We meet every Friday at 1:00 PM ET for the general meetings, all are welcome to join. 

In addition, we host a separate subgroup on the following topic also on Fridays:
* VEX Playbooks

## Progress

We are currently working on a) helping the NIST National Vulnerability Database team decide how best to fix software identification problems in the NVD, b) working with the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) to understand SBOMs and design the "green field" vulnerability database mandated by NIS2, and c) convening a group to develop "playbooks" for creating and using VEX documents in the two major formats: CSAF VEX and Cyclone DX VEX.
