The SBOM Forum identifies and tries to find solutions to problems that are preventing widespread distribution and use of software bills of materials (SBOMs) by organizations whose primary business is not software development.

## Weekly Meetings

We meet every Friday at 1:00 PM ET for general meetings. At these meetings, we discuss issues that are currently inhibiting use of SBOMs by private and public sector organizations in general.  All are welcome to join. Email <tom@tomalrich.com> to be added to the mailing list and to receive the meeting invitations. Running meeting notes are here. 

We are currently working on these documents. Anyone is welcome to comment or suggest changes to them:

* [Challenges inhibiting SBOM and VEX uptake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FBFdSFaMnOq43b4oWV741ETSRb8TQUiqXpHSQywr1MU/edit){:target="_blank"}
* [How are device SBOMs different from “user-managed” software SBOMs?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHNRdNzhC5o4nvdkVwHwcsONi3qVgM0ABgbfhm8jpVY/edit){:target="_blank"}
* [The problem of forked components](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBeOJEFbdkdaJaaflMpqDy4NQdhSi70pJTX6YJkqS60/edit){:target="_blank"}

## Subgroups

VEX Playbooks

The purpose of this subgroup is to address the problem that there is no complete VEX specification for either of the two major VEX formats: [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/){:target="_blank"} and [CSAF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csd01/csaf-v2.0-csd01.html){:target="_blank"}. Lacking this, there can be no VEX consumer tools that are guaranteed to read documents produced by VEX supplier tools, and vice versa. This group will produce VEX specs in both formats (starting with CSAF) and then develop playbooks that describe how to create and ingest documents in both formats (we also may develop prototype tools in both formats). 

At least initially, the only VEX use case addressed will be the one developed by the NTIA Software Component Transparency Initiative, which is described in this NTIA document; Tom’s opinion is that the fact that this VEX use case isn’t being addressed is the biggest inhibitor to the widespread distribution to and use of SBOMs by organizations whose primary business is not software development.

This group meets every other Friday morning at 11AM Eastern Time. Running meeting notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdc0S9J9R6b6iffh4v0caLeb-dmzV17XIcUC4ZY11rk/edit#heading=h.j81d041rtiua){:target="_blank"}. To join the mailing list and receive the meeting invitations, email <tom@tomalrich.com>.

The document we are currently working on is below. All are welcome to comment and suggest changes:

[Primary use case for VEX documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i8p5LtYj3cXWlp1R4CLpRtl7b_5SYKQMIN6m4Xjt2bU/edit){:target="_blank"}

## Other areas of effort
1.	We have provided advice to the NIST National Vulnerability Database team as they decide how to fix software identification problems in the NVD, based on our “Proposal to Operationalize…” document listed below.
2.	We will be working with the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) to help them understand SBOMs.
3.	We will also provide recommendations to ENISA as they design the “greenfield” EU vulnerability database mandated by the NIS 2 cybersecurity regulation. NIS 2 came into effect in 2022.

## Supporting the SBOM Forum

There are three ways you can support our work. All three are appreciated!

1.	You can participate in our meetings and help create documents with us. See above.
2.	You can donate to the OWASP Foundation (minimum $10), to help them carry out their great work promoting software security. Click the “Donate” button in the top right corner. The OWASP Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization. Therefore, in some cases your gift may be tax-deductible. You should consult with a tax professional for more details. Note that your gift will support the general work of the OWASP Foundation.
3.	You can make a “restricted” donation to the OWASP Foundation, which is restricted to supporting the SBOM Forum. The minimum restricted donation is $1,000. The OWASP Foundation charges the SBOM Forum a 10% administrative fee to cover their costs in administering this type of donation, which we believe is justified by the strong level of support they have provided to our group. Your logo will appear on our page if your organization is able to donate at one of these three levels: Silver ($5,000+), Gold ($10,000+) or Platinum ($25,000+). However, any donation is greatly appreciated!


If you would like to make a restricted donation, you can simply click on the “Donate” button in the upper right corner of the main SBOM Forum web page. On the next page, you should choose “Other” when asked to choose an amount for a donation. You will be prompted to enter an amount and asked to enter your email address and name (of course, if you’re donating on behalf of a company, you should enter the company name, although you can enter your email). 

If you enter an amount over $1,000 (the minimum for a restricted donation), a checkbox will appear which reads “Please restrict this gift for OWASP SBOM Forum…” Please check that box.

Please email tom@tomalrich.com if you would like to discuss donations and what they will be used for.
