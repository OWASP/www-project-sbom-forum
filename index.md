The SBOM Forum identifies and tries to find solutions to problems that are preventing widespread distribution and use of software bills of materials (SBOMs) by organizations whose primary business is not software development.

## Weekly Meetings

We meet every Friday at 1:00 PM ET for general meetings. At these meetings, we discuss issues that are currently inhibiting use of SBOMs by private and public sector organizations in general.  All are welcome to join. Email <tom@tomalrich.com> to be added to the mailing list and to receive the meeting invitations. Running meeting notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yqaVzV5U33Lbhb7bANWPIxSwoU3F_xLrCt05SU5yTkE/edit){:target="_blank"}. 

We are currently working on these documents. Anyone is welcome to comment or suggest changes to them:

* [Challenges inhibiting SBOM and VEX uptake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FBFdSFaMnOq43b4oWV741ETSRb8TQUiqXpHSQywr1MU/edit){:target="_blank"}
* [How are device SBOMs different from “user-managed” software SBOMs?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHNRdNzhC5o4nvdkVwHwcsONi3qVgM0ABgbfhm8jpVY/edit){:target="_blank"}
* [The problem of forked components](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBeOJEFbdkdaJaaflMpqDy4NQdhSi70pJTX6YJkqS60/edit){:target="_blank"}

## Subgroups

**VEX Playbooks**

The purpose of this subgroup is to address the problem that there is no complete VEX specification for either of the two major VEX formats: [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/){:target="_blank"} and [CSAF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csd01/csaf-v2.0-csd01.html){:target="_blank"}. Lacking this, there can be no VEX consumer tools that are guaranteed to read documents produced by VEX supplier tools, and vice versa. This group will produce VEX specs in both formats (starting with CSAF) and then develop playbooks that describe how to create and ingest documents in both formats (we also may develop prototype tools in both formats). 

At least initially, the only VEX use case addressed will be the one developed by the NTIA Software Component Transparency Initiative, which is described in [this NTIA document](https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/vex_one-page_summary_0.pdf){:target="_blank"}; Tom’s opinion is that the fact that this VEX use case isn’t being addressed is the biggest inhibitor to the widespread distribution to and use of SBOMs by organizations whose primary business is not software development.

This group meets every other Friday morning at 11AM Eastern Time. Running meeting notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdc0S9J9R6b6iffh4v0caLeb-dmzV17XIcUC4ZY11rk/edit#heading=h.j81d041rtiua){:target="_blank"}. To join the mailing list and receive the meeting invitations, email <tom@tomalrich.com>.

The document we are currently working on is below. All are welcome to comment and suggest changes:

[Primary use case for VEX documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i8p5LtYj3cXWlp1R4CLpRtl7b_5SYKQMIN6m4Xjt2bU/edit){:target="_blank"}

## Other areas of effort
1.	We have provided advice to the NIST National Vulnerability Database team as they decide how to fix software identification problems in the NVD, based on our “Proposal to Operationalize…” document listed below.
2.	We will be working with the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) to help them understand SBOMs.
3.	We will also provide recommendations to ENISA as they design the “greenfield” EU vulnerability database mandated by the NIS 2 cybersecurity regulation. NIS 2 came into effect in 2022.
